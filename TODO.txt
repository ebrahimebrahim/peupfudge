=========================

where do quantitive base physical characteristics like speed go? in with health or as their own system?

devise system to determine movement speed in various situations
- gm should choose, for each creature of world, what are the types of locomotion and what are base speeds for each
- e.g. humans could have walking, running, sprinting
- if want, can choose an ability from tree to serve as modifier. (come up with formula to modify)
- if want, can have a fatigue/energy bar or health condition to limit some types of locomotion
- idea for an advanced mechanic: penalties to speed or fatigue due to inventory weight

Y
need to devise a health system
- conditions and trauma (come up with clear and short way to describe distinction)
- conditions are handled by flowcharts
  - gm should make one of these for each health condition they'd like to have for each type of creature in their world.
  - a node is a particular state with respect to the condition,
    complete with a description of the effects (e.g. penalties to abilities) of being in that state.
  - each edge is labeled with the event that triggers a state transition,
    and it can branch into multiple target nodes with multiple probabilities.
    - convert probabilities to convenient dice rolls.
    - these branchings can also be labeled with abilities that modify the rolls.
  - example: bleeding
  - the full info in these flowcharts could be considered to be some sort of medical knowledge.
    it is up to the gm how much of it to reveal to players.
- trauma is handled as a list of injuries
  - how should injuries be described? do we provide a standard way like "scratch", "hurt", etc?
  - gm should consider, for each ability, which body parts are needed for it.
    (we should come up with how injury penalty works to affect abilities).
  - ... how do injuries heal?

E
test and tweak combat system:
- rig up damage-->wound table such that it makes sense to simply add (merged) ability levels directly to damage factor
- make grazing damage and hit damage formulas good
- suggest gm to make body diagram with sizes and protections coming from protection<-->size table
- tell gm to calibrate size measurements for protection in terms of size of thing that it would take a good punch to scratch

scale wound bubs to number of body parts.
e.g. blobman vs equally matched human with limbs vs equally matched spoida should be a fair battle
- everything should have same total bubs
- should bub distribution be a thing? if so, should scratch-hurt ratio be fixed?
- how do injury penalties scale with bub scaling?

question to answer later when we know more:
should we make players pay attention to R+M with AND without targetting penalty,
and then insert some non-miss (maybe graze) consequence for succeeding on R+M without?
or is that too much to keep track of to be worth it?
(we qould just have more detailed targetting system under "advanced mechanics" in appendix)

write general suggestion on merging ability levels if needed by going to nearest common ancestor

add weapon type to sitmod and Delta

write: health, wounds, movement, intro


===================
=== Needed next ===
===================


make qul graph demonstrating orders

write a bit more about bars.

have a chapter on modules, move combat section there.
remember to move attacks paragraph of tree design section to there also

come up with a better term for hitting factors

how to control spread in test 5 for ability tree?

is there a better way to handle weighted average for att bonus? seems disruptive to calculate

consider introducing the following into qombat:
- evasion
- pulling punches
- knocking out
- stunning
- crits

additional things:
- illustrations
  - at least need awesome cover illustration
  - illustrations can be of practical and not just aesthetic value:
    for each mechanic an illustration of the example that goes with it can make it much easier to remember later
  - a giant using a tree as a toothpick
  - a pocket calculator
  - dice
  - an AI distributed on multiple systems
  - a guy trying to climb a cliff while dodging falling boulders
  - a guy climbing an "ability" tree
  - a humanoid amorphous blob with one body part fighting a spider with lots of parts
  - character in a cave fighting against theoretical constructs that look like wisps from WC3
    that are invincible and blink out of existence 10 seconds after their birth
  - someone stabilizing a bleeding person
  - a character chasing a chicken, with the trajectory indicated with regular distance markings
  - a basketball
  - a bunch of characters missing and deflecting against a big boss character like bartholophat or lavos
- appendix
  - reference sheet
  - base character sheet
  - example trees
  - examples of the various mechanics
  - list of questions the GM should answer
  - some sort of glossary of game mechanics (use peupfudge.ind to extract page numbers)?
    or does index sort of play that role?
  - a section on advanced mechanics
    - order gap and gluing together scales of different order
    - more specific ways of calculating some of the things in sitmod
    - a more detailed targetting system?
