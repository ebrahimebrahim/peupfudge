how to control spread in test 5 for ability tree?

is there a better way to handle weighted average for att bonus? seems disruptive to calculate

where do quantitive base physical characteristics like speed go? in with health or as their own system?

need to devise a health system
then decide how damage should translate into injuries
and how injuries should affect character performance
remember to examine the grazing damage formula and make sure it's okay

what should  be targetting penalty if you're going for an eye? for a torso?

question to answer later when we know more:
should we make players pay attention to R+M with AND without targetting penalty,
and then insert some non-miss (maybe graze) consequence for succeeding on R+M without?
or is that too much to keep track of to be worth it?

consider giving a frame of reference for what the numbers could be for all sitmods

test and tweak combat system

write:
- health
- wounds
- movement
- intro

additional things:
- illustrations
  - at least need awesome cover illustration
  - illustrations can be of practical and not just aesthetic value:
    for each mechanic an illustration of the example that goes with it can make it much easier to remember later
- appendix
  - reference sheet
  - base character sheet
  - example trees
  - examples of the various mechanics
  - list of questions the GM should answer
  - some sort of glossary of game mechanics (use peupfudge.ind to extract page numbers)?
    or does index sort of play that role?
  - a section on advanced mechanics
    - order gap and gluing together scales of different order
    - more specific ways of calculating some of the things in sitmod

scale wound bubs to number of body parts.
e.g. blobman vs equally matched human with limbs should be a fair battle

shift levels back to 0
  - ok it's done in manual but there are some aspects of peuptest that still need to be fixed to work with it

write attacks section in tree design?

change damage factor so that d_A is a merging of all relevant abilities.
consider the meaningfulness of a general sort of ability level merging.
consider how orders would come in too.

make qul graph demonstrating orders
