quantify targetting penalty, now that we have sizes quantified in the form of a body diagram
--> Actually, now I am thinking we should leave it as is. Because
    (a) it's good and less complicated as it is and
    (b) connecting it to the body diagram needlessly forces targets to be body parts,
        while it's nice that they are allowed to be more detailed currently
        (e.g. eyes are not on the example human body diagram).

section on character death in health sec

put distributions table for 4dF in 1.1 section "numbers and adjectives"

come up with a better term for hitting factors

further test combat system
  scale wound bubs to number of body parts.
  e.g. blobman vs equally matched human with limbs vs equally matched spoida should be a fair battle

how to control spread in test 5 for ability tree?

is there a better way to handle weighted average for att bonus? seems disruptive to calculate

consider introducing the following into qombat:
- evasion
- pulling punches
- knocking out
- stunning
- crits

additional things:
- illustrations
  - at least need awesome cover illustration
  - illustrations can be of practical and not just aesthetic value:
    for each mechanic an illustration of the example that goes with it can make it much easier to remember later
  - a giant using a tree as a toothpick
  - a pocket calculator
  - dice
  - an AI distributed on multiple systems
  - a guy trying to climb a cliff while dodging falling boulders
  - a guy climbing an "ability" tree
  - a humanoid amorphous blob with one body part fighting a spider with lots of parts
  - character in a cave fighting against theoretical constructs that look like wisps from WC3
    that are invincible and blink out of existence 10 seconds after their birth
  - someone stabilizing a bleeding person
  - a character chasing a chicken, with the trajectory indicated with regular distance markings
  - a basketball
  - a bunch of characters missing and deflecting against a big boss character like bartholophat or lavos
  - a bar [|||||---]
- appendix
  - reference sheet
  - base character sheet
  - example trees
  - examples of the various mechanics
  - some sort of glossary of game mechanics (use peupfudge.ind to extract page numbers)?
    or does index sort of play that role?
  - fudge dice roll probabilities
  - example flowcharts (severe bleeding, infection, random diseases, hunger)
  - formulas for things like xp table in case people need to go over range in table
  - a section on advanced mechanics
    - order gap and gluing together scales of different order
    - more specific ways of calculating some of the things in sitmod
    - a more detailed targetting system?
    - ways of handling fatigue and movement speed penalties due to inventory weight
