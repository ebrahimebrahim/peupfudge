how to control spread in test 5 for ability tree?

is there a better way to handle weighted average for att bonus? seems disruptive to calculate

consider doing > for action resolution or sticking with >= for opposed actions even when they are combat (so make graze 0)

where do quantitive base physical characteristics like speed go? in with health or as their own system?

need to devise a health system
then decide how damage should translate into injuries
and how injuries should affect character performance
remember to examine the grazing damage formula and make sure it's okay
