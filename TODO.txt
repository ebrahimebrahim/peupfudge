write general suggestion on merging ability levels if needed by going to nearest common ancestor

write intro

question to answer later when we know more:
should we make players pay attention to R+M with AND without targetting penalty,
and then insert some non-miss (maybe graze) consequence for succeeding on R+M without?
or is that too much to keep track of to be worth it?
(we qould just have more detailed targetting system under "advanced mechanics" in appendix)

section on character death in health sec

make qul graph demonstrating orders

put distributions table for 4dF in 1.1 section "numbers and adjectives"

write a bit more about bars.

have a chapter on modules, move combat section there.
remember to move attacks paragraph of tree design section to there also

come up with a better term for hitting factors

further test combat system
  scale wound bubs to number of body parts.
  e.g. blobman vs equally matched human with limbs vs equally matched spoida should be a fair battle

how to control spread in test 5 for ability tree?

is there a better way to handle weighted average for att bonus? seems disruptive to calculate

consider introducing the following into qombat:
- evasion
- pulling punches
- knocking out
- stunning
- crits

additional things:
- illustrations
  - at least need awesome cover illustration
  - illustrations can be of practical and not just aesthetic value:
    for each mechanic an illustration of the example that goes with it can make it much easier to remember later
  - a giant using a tree as a toothpick
  - a pocket calculator
  - dice
  - an AI distributed on multiple systems
  - a guy trying to climb a cliff while dodging falling boulders
  - a guy climbing an "ability" tree
  - a humanoid amorphous blob with one body part fighting a spider with lots of parts
  - character in a cave fighting against theoretical constructs that look like wisps from WC3
    that are invincible and blink out of existence 10 seconds after their birth
  - someone stabilizing a bleeding person
  - a character chasing a chicken, with the trajectory indicated with regular distance markings
  - a basketball
  - a bunch of characters missing and deflecting against a big boss character like bartholophat or lavos
- appendix
  - reference sheet
  - base character sheet
  - example trees
  - examples of the various mechanics
  - list of questions the GM should answer
  - some sort of glossary of game mechanics (use peupfudge.ind to extract page numbers)?
    or does index sort of play that role?
  - a section on advanced mechanics
    - order gap and gluing together scales of different order
    - more specific ways of calculating some of the things in sitmod
    - a more detailed targetting system?
    - ways of handling fatigue and movement speed penalties due to inventory weight
