how to control spread in test 5 for ability tree?

is there a better way to handle weighted average for att bonus? seems disruptive to calculate

where do quantitive base physical characteristics like speed go? in with health or as their own system?

need to devise a health system
then decide how damage should translate into injuries
and how injuries should affect character performance
remember to examine the grazing damage formula and make sure it's okay

what should  be targetting penalty if you're going for an eye? for a torso?

question to answer later when we know more:
should we make players pay attention to R+M with AND without targetting penalty,
and then insert some non-miss (maybe graze) consequence for succeeding on R+M without?
or is that too much to keep track of to be worth it?

consider giving a frame of reference for what the numbers could be for all sitmods
