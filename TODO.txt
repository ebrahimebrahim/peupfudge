how to control spread in test 5 for ability tree?

is there a better way to handle weighted average for att bonus? seems disruptive to calculate

where do quantitive base physical characteristics like speed go? in with health or as their own system?

devise system to determine movement speed in various situations

need to devise a health system
then decide how damage should translate into injuries
and how injuries should affect character performance (injury penalty)

question to answer later when we know more:
should we make players pay attention to R+M with AND without targetting penalty,
and then insert some non-miss (maybe graze) consequence for succeeding on R+M without?
or is that too much to keep track of to be worth it?
(we qould just have more detailed targetting system under "advanced mechanics" in appendix)

E
test and tweak combat system:
- rig up damage-->wound table such that it makes sense to simply add (merged) ability levels directly to damage factor
- make grazing damage and hit damage formulas good

scale wound bubs to number of body parts.
e.g. blobman vs equally matched human with limbs should be a fair battle

Y
rewrite damage factor section:
- don't separate d into just two components, instead list things like sitmod
- one of the things to list is a relevant ability level, or better yet, nearest common ancestor of relevant ability levels
- explain that the gm judges other stuff based on damage-->wound table.

write general suggestion on merging ability levels if needed by going to nearest common ancestor

add weapon type to sitmod

come up with formal words and accompanying explanation for the four "combat modifiers"

change damage factor so that d_A is a merging of all relevant abilities.
consider the meaningfulness of a general sort of ability level merging.
consider how orders would come in too.

write:
- health
- wounds
- movement
- intro

consider introducing the following into qombat:
- evasion
- pulling punches
- knocking out
- stunning
- crits

additional things:
- illustrations
  - at least need awesome cover illustration
  - illustrations can be of practical and not just aesthetic value:
    for each mechanic an illustration of the example that goes with it can make it much easier to remember later
  - a giant using a tree as a toothpick
  - a pocket calculator
  - an AI distributed on multiple systems
  - a guy trying to climb a cliff while dodging falling boulders
  - a guy climbing an "ability" tree
  - a humanoid amorphous blob with one body part fighting a spider with lots of parts
  - character in a cave fighting against theoretical constructs that look like wisps from WC3
    that are invincible and blink out of existence 10 seconds after their birth
- appendix
  - reference sheet
  - base character sheet
  - example trees
  - examples of the various mechanics
  - list of questions the GM should answer
  - some sort of glossary of game mechanics (use peupfudge.ind to extract page numbers)?
    or does index sort of play that role?
  - a section on advanced mechanics
    - order gap and gluing together scales of different order
    - more specific ways of calculating some of the things in sitmod
    - a more detailed targetting system?



make qul graph demonstrating orders

write a bit more about bars.
