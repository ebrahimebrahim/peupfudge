\begin{example}
You are a mage. You are near the end of an arduous journey to find a golden teapot at the end of a treacherous dungeon.
You open the door to the final room, and find yourself in a long, narrow room largely taken up by a gaping abyss.
On the other side of the abyss you see the teapot glowing bright!
You fish through your pack for a Scroll of Magical Bridge.
Your level in the Construction Magic ability is $6$,
but the GM determines
$D = 7$
by considering that a standard being with $7$ levels worth of Construction Magic XP would succeed half the time at casting this spell over an abyss of that size.
Additionally, you recently fell ill after eating the wrong kind of dungeon mushroom,
and this gave a property ``Shroom Belly'' that makes it harder to focus on magic,
granting $A = -1$ for magical actions.
You roll $4$dF... and you get $+3$!
$L = 6$, $A = -1$, $R = +3$, $D = 7$, and $8 \geq 7$.
You successfully weave the bridge into existence, walk across it, and grab the golden teapot, victorious!
The GM awards you $10$ XP for completion of this narrative chunk.
You decide to allocate $7$ XP towards Construction Magic, and $3$ XP towards Mycology (another ability you used in this dungeon, albeit not successfully).
Construction Magic already had $22$ XP allocated to it (out of the $64$ XP required to raise it to level $7$), and now has $29$.
Mycology was at level $0$, and has now been raised to level $2$.

\begin{example}
The first session of a new \peupfudge{} campaign is about to start.
The GM tells the players, Kurt and Olivia, about the world, showing them a world map and a character sheet template with a few traits on it specific to this campaign.
The GM has chosen the set of abilities to be represented in this campaign, and has also decided how to interpret the proficiency of levels for different abilities:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{5.3em}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{5.3em}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{5.3em}|}
\cline{2-4}
                                 & poor level & decent level & great level \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Muscle}     & 2          & 4            & 6           \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Charisma}   & 2          & 4            & 6           \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Perception} & 2          & 4            & 6           \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Knowledge}  & 3          & 5            & 7           \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
According to this interpretation, attaining a Knowledge level that would be described as ``decent'' requires more time (and hence more XP)
than attaining a Muscle level that would be described as ``decent.''

The GM says that in this campaign players will first allocate their starting XP ($50$ each), then choose properties, then come up with a backstory that is congruent with their abilities and properties.
Kurt names his character Kotorikh, and Olivia names her character Obazana.
For Kotorikh, Kurt allocates $19$ XP to Perception and $31$ XP to Knowledge.
For Obazana, Olivia allocates $21$ XP to Muscle, $13$ XP to Charisma, $7$ XP to Perception, and $9$ XP to Knowledge.
In order to determine the resulting levels and the XP progress towards the next level, section \ref{sec:abilities} is applied:
$\textrm{xp required to level up} = 2^\textrm{old level}$.
Their ability levels after allocation are displayed along with any XP progress towards the next levels:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{xp_allocation_example.pdf}
\end{center}

Next, the GM hands the players a list of pre-made properties, and tells them that they can each choose one starting property for their characters.
Kurt chooses ``talented observer'' for Kotorikh, which grants a one-time bonus $+7$ starting XP towards Perception, so his Perception is still $4$, but with $11/16$ now allocated towards the next level.
Olivia chooses ``wealthy'' for Obazana, guaranteeing that Obazana will start with a nice heap of rare jewels.

Next, the GM has Kurt and Olivia describe backstories for their characters.
Kotorikh is a keen and curious archaeologist from a distant village, who became fascinated by reading about ancient civilizations after his traveling uncle taught him to read and brought him back many books.
Obazana is a skilled and successful blacksmith from a large city who one day hopes to make weapons and armor for the king’s royal guard.

Next, the GM describes the setup for the campaign.
Kotorikh, through his readings, believes he has found clues of an ancient civilization that lived underground beneath distant mountains.
He has reason to believe they had access to a powerful metal unknown to current society.
He and Obazana have been corresponding via letter, and they have agreed to search for the ancient civilization together.
Kotorikh hopes to uncover its mysteries and Obazana hopes to discover the powerful metal to make her shop the best in the city.

At the start of the campaign, Kotorikh and Obazana have traveled far from their homes, and have just met at a town halfway between them, leading up to a long path to the mountain range.
There is one status in the campaign, ``Energy.'' Its states are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rested (+1 to A for actions involving Muscle or Perception)
\item Neutral (no effect)
\item Tired (-1 to A for actions involving Muscle or Perception)
\item Exhausted (-2 to A for actions involving Muscle or Perception)
\end{itemize}
To move up in Energy, the GM decides a character must take a ``restful action,'' such as sleeping, eating a warm meal, or drinking certain potions.
To move down in Energy, a character must exert themselves in a particularly tiring way.
Kotorikh and Obazana both start off Tired due to their long journey thus far.

Next, the GM gives the player characters their starting inventory.
He bases it off their profession and backgrounds.
Kotorikh starts with a pack containing a magnifying glass, a map, a guide to regional plants, a book of myths, eight sheets of parchment, a vial of ink, a quill,
a worn old shovel, a sling, and a pouch containing $12$ stones.
Obazana starts with iron armor and a pack containing a quality iron sword, a quality iron axe, a pocket knife, a shard of flint, a smithing hammer, a whetstone,
and a pouch containing $10$ rare jewels.

As an example, Kotorikh’s character sheet at the start of the game is shown below.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{char_sheet_example.pdf}
\end{center}

The GM gives the players a quick description of the town the PCs are starting in.
The PCs explore it, and soon decide to sleep due to their Tired state.
After asking around, they discover that the only inn in town is very expensive, demanding three of Obazana’s jewels for both of them to stay the night.
They decide to sleep outside instead.
While sleeping, the GM requests Perception checks of both characters; unbeknownst to them, someone is trying to steal the jewels while they sleep!
The GM determines that $D$ will be $3$ for them to wake up to this particular bandit (that is, someone with a Perception of $3$ would wake up to this bandit about half the time).
Kotorikh has an $L$ of $4$ in Perception, an $A$ of $-1$ due to his Tired state, and rolls $4$dF getting $R = -1$, for $L+A+R = 2$.
Obazana has an $L$ of $3$ in Perception, an $A$ of $-1$ due to her Tired state, and rolls $4$dF getting $R = 0$, for $L+A+R = 2$.
They sleep peacefully through the night, and wake up with their Energy state changed from “Tired” to “Neutral.” But...all of the jewels are missing!
They ask around to see if anyone had seen the thief.
Perhaps they should have just slept at the inn.

\begin{example}
You are the GM and the players have just fought their way into a dungeon room with a closed door at the opposite end.
The door is cracked open from the other side, just barely revealing a stack of nasty gremlins.
Adam announces that his archer character attempts to fire an arrow into the narrow crack.
As the GM, you need to set the difficulty $D$ for this action.
You decide that in order to have about a $50\%$ chance of success, one would need about a year of dedicated archery training.
Earlier in the campaign a different character did a month of dedicated training and received $2$ XP for her Archery ability.
A year of dedicated archery training then corresponds to $24$ XP, which corresponds to a level of about $4$.
So you let Adam know that $D=4$ for this action.
``That’s pretty harsh man,'' Adam complains.
``It’s not that hard for an archery task.''
Being the wise GM that you are, you understand that $D$ comes down to the amount of needed practice and not a comparison with similar tasks.
Once you explain how you determined $D$, Adam has a further complaint:
``My Archery ability level is $2$, which corresponds to $3$ XP.
By your convention that’s $1.5$ months of archery practice… but my character has been an archer for like $3$ months!
What gives?!
Why do I get less XP?!'' After calming Adam down, you explain that his character’s practice wasn’t dedicated archery training.
His $3$ months of undedicated practice is being treated as though it were $1.5$ months of dedicated training.
Finally, Adam needs to roll to resolve the action.
With $L=2$ and $D=4$, it appears that Adam has to roll at least $+2$ to succeed.
Rolling $4$dF, this gives him about a $1/5$ chance of success.
Adam rolls his $4$dF and gets $R=-1$, failing the shot.
Since $-1$ is not such a surprising roll, you do not interpret Adam’s failure in a dramatically unlucky way.
His relative performance, on the other hand, is quite low: $L+A+R-D = 2+0-1-4 = -3$.
And so you narrate that the arrow appears to have had little hope of hitting its target,
and the gremlins all snicker at Adam’s character.

\begin{example}
Three characters, Gromanno (PC), Nyrv (NPC), and Polthova (PC) just came across a set of exquisite marbles in a cave, and they all want it.
They decide to race to the entrance of the cave, and the marbles will go to the winner.
The GM says that this will be treated as an opposed action,
where $L+A+R$ is compared among all participants, and the ability being used is \emph{Fitness}.
In this campaign,
a Fitness of $2$ is interpreted as poor,
a Fitness of $4$ is interpreted as decent,
and a Fitness of $7$ is interpreted as excellent.
Here is the outcome for $L$, $A$, and $R$:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$L$: Gromanno has a Fitness of $2$, Nyrv has a Fitness of $5$, and Polthova is a professional athlete with a Fitness of $8$.
\item
$A$: Gromanno is wearing his ``Old running shoes [$+1$ to $A$ for running actions]'' and the GM gives him an $A$ of $+1$ for this.
Nyrv has the property ``Poor low-light vision'' and can’t navigate well in the cave, and the GM gives her an $A$ of $-1$ for this.
Polthova does not have any distinct character-based factors that would affect his $A$ for this action, and the GM gives him an $A$ of 0.
\item
$R$: They all roll $3$dF.
Gromanno’s player rolls a $0$ for him, the GM rolls a $+2$ for Nyrv, and Polthova’s player rolls a $-3$ for him.
\end{itemize}
Comparing $L+A+R$ for all participants:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gromanno: $2+1+0 = 3$
\item Nyrv: $5-1+2 = 6$
\item Polthova: $8+0-3 = 5$
\end{itemize}
The GM narrates the events that led to this outcome.
Polthova, very fit, started out ahead, with the other two trailing far behind him.
But due to his terrible luck, around two thirds of the way through, he slipped on some cave slime and injured his ankle.
He limped the rest of the way to the entrance.
Nyrv exerted herself very well and was able to push through her difficulty navigating, and eventually surpassed the limping Polthova.
Gromanno, as expected, trailed behind the other two, despite his nice running shoes.
Nyrv emerges from the cave first, victorious, delighted in her new set of exquisite marbles!

\begin{example}
In a campaign where the GM has decided that humans are the standard being for the Strength ability,
and that a Strength level of 3 is to be interpreted as ``decent,'' an odd group of pals is sitting around a table arm wrestling.
One is a hobbit, one is a cyborg human with a mechanical left arm, and one is an ant bodybuilder.
\begin{itemize}
\item The hobbit, small by nature, has an unmodified Strength of $3$ (for the purposes of determining the XP cost of leveling up) and a property
``hobbit strength'' that modifies his Strength by $-1$ (for the purposes of using Strength in an action); his i$L$ is therefore represented as $3-1=2$.
\item The cyborg human has an unmodified Strength of $3$, and a property ``cyborg left arm'' that modifies his Strength by $+2$ when using the arm in an action;
his $L$ for Strength for actions using his left arm can be represented as $3+2=5$, and for actions not using his left arm would be represented as $3+0=3$.
\item The ant, an avid athlete but several orders of magnitude smaller than its friends, has a property ``bug strength'' that modifies its Strength by $-50$.
Its $L$ is represented as $7-50=-43$.
\end{itemize}
The GM and players agree that $A$ for all characters is $0$ here, with no current situational factors that will aid or hold back any characters.

The GM decides to resolve the arm wrestling match as a series of opposed actions.
He believes that this is an action that incorporates less luck than most actions (where the better prepared character is more certain to succeed than usual),
and decides that $1$dF is to be used for $R$.

The group agrees to using their left arms (left foreleg in the case of the ant), as is customary in this world.
The hobbit and the cyborg face off first:
the hobbit rolls a $+1$ for an $L+A+R$ of $2+0+1=3$, and the cyborg rolls a $-1$ for an $L+A+R$ of $5+0-1=4$.
After a long back-and-forth struggle, the cyborg wins.

Next, the hobbit and the ant face off.
The hobbit’s arm is tired after the last match, and $A$ for him will be $-1$ for this next match.
The hobbit rolls a $-1$ for an $L+A+R$ of $2-1-1=0$, and the ant rolls a $+1$ for an $L+A+R$ of $-43+0+1=-42$.
Despite the ant’s noble preparation and efforts, it is flung across the room immediately.

The pals schedule a rematch, and each of them resolves to train in preparation.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The hobbit lifts weights for a few minutes every day.
After a few weeks of training,
the GM awards the hobbit $9$ XP to be allocated to Strength, raising his unmodified Strength to $4$ ($+1/16$ towards the next level).
His $L$ would now be represented as $4-1=3$.
\item
The cyborg human repeatedly exerts his left arm in a misguided attempt to apply biological strength training concepts to a mechanical arm.
No XP is gained.
\item
The ant is determined to level up its Strength.
The ant’s current unmodified Strength is $7$, so the XP needed for a level-up is $2^7$, and the ant trains accordingly.
The ant’s effective Strength for the next match has increased to $L=8-50=-42$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
